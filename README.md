# PlaySmarter

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is simple. We all have limited life and too many things to do. And one big chunk of that time goes to entertainment, more specifically books, movies, TV series, you name it.

And this project serves the sole purpose of providing a better, more personal
guidance for the selection of entertainment. Better filtering, better ranking.

## Currently supported function:
- Batch mark watched movies from Douban.
- List and rank movies based on collect_count, rating, and year.
- Batch crawl movies of a certain genre.

### Filter
- Filter movies based on genre.
- Filter the watched movies.
